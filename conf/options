# Don't detach from the terminal
#nodetach

# With this option, pppd will detach from its controlling terminal once it has
# successfully established the ppp connection (to the point where the first
# network control protocol, usually the IP control protocol, has come up).
updetach

# Specifies that pppd should use a UUCP-style lock on the serial device
# to ensure exclusive access to the device.
lock

# Do not exit after a connection is terminated; instead try to reopen the
# connection. The maxfail option still has an effect on persistent connections.
persist

# Terminate after n consecutive failed connection attempts.
# A value of 0 means no limit. The default value is 10.
maxfail 10

# Specifies how many seconds to wait before re-initiating the link after
# it terminates. This option only has any effect if the persist or demand
# option is used. The holdoff period is not applied if the link was
# terminated because it was idle.
